<member name='FileReadMoreCallback'>
<summary>
When loading the partial contents of a file with g_file_load_partial_contents_async(),
it may become necessary to determine if any more data from the file should be loaded.
A <see cref="FileReadMoreCallback"/> function facilitates this by returning <c>true</c> if more data
should be read, or <c>false</c> otherwise.
