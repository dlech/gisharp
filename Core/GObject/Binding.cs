    /// <see cref="Binding"/> is the representation of a binding between a property on a

    /// instance (or target).
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Whenever the source property changes, the same
    /// value is applied to the target property; for instance, the following
    /// binding:
    /// 
    /// |[&lt;!-- language="C" --&gt;
    ///   g_object_bind_property (object1, "property-a",
    ///                           object2, "property-b",
    ///                           G_BINDING_DEFAULT);
    /// ]|
    ///
    /// will cause the property named "property-b" of @object2 to be updated
    /// every time g_object_set() or the specific accessor changes the value of
    /// the property "property-a" of @object1.
    ///
    /// It is possible to create a bidirectional binding between two properties
    /// of two #GObject instances, so that if either property changes, the
    /// other is updated as well, for instance:
    ///
    /// |[&lt;!-- language="C" --&gt;
    ///   g_object_bind_property (object1, "property-a",
    ///                           object2, "property-b",
    ///                           G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL);
    /// ]|
    ///
    /// will keep the two properties in sync.
    ///
    /// It is also possible to set a custom transformation function (in both
    /// directions, in case of a bidirectional binding) to apply a custom
    /// transformation from the source value to the target value before
    /// applying it; for instance, the following binding:
    ///
    /// |[&lt;!-- language="C" --&gt;
    ///   g_object_bind_property_full (adjustment1, "value",
    ///                                adjustment2, "value",
    ///                                G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL,
    ///                                celsius_to_fahrenheit,
    ///                                fahrenheit_to_celsius,
    ///                                NULL, NULL);
    /// ]|
    ///
    /// will keep the "value" property of the two adjustments in sync; the
    /// @celsius_to_fahrenheit function will be called whenever the "value"
    /// property of @adjustment1 changes and will transform the current value
    /// of the property before applying it to the "value" property of @adjustment2.
    ///
    /// Vice versa, the @fahrenheit_to_celsius function will be called whenever
    /// the "value" property of @adjustment2 changes, and will transform the
    /// current value of the property before applying it to the "value" property
    /// of @adjustment1.
    ///
    /// Note that #GBinding does not resolve cycles by itself; a cycle like
    ///
    /// |[
    ///   object1:propertyA -&gt; object2:propertyB
    ///   object2:propertyB -&gt; object3:propertyC
    ///   object3:propertyC -&gt; object1:propertyA
    /// ]|

    /// if the value has effectively been changed. A binding is implemented

    /// various ways of blocking a signal emission, like g_signal_stop_emission()
    /// or g_signal_handler_block().
    ///
    /// A binding will be severed, and the resources it allocates freed, whenever
    /// either one of the #GObject instances it refers to are finalized, or when
    /// the #GBinding instance loses its last reference.
