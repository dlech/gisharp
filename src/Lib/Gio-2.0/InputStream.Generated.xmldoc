<remarks>
<para>
Once the stream is closed, all other operations will return <see cref="IOErrorEnum.Closed"/>.
Closing a stream multiple times will not return an error.
</para>
<para>
Streams will be automatically closed when the last reference
is dropped, but you might want to call this function to make sure
resources are released as early as possible.
</para>
<para>
Some streams might keep the backing store of the stream (e.g. a file descriptor)
open after the stream is closed. See the documentation for the individual
stream for details.
</para>
<para>
On failure the first error that happened will be reported, but the close
operation will finish as much as possible. A stream that failed to
close will still return <see cref="IOErrorEnum.Closed"/> for all operations. Still, it
is important to check and report the error to the user.

If <paramref name="cancellable"/> is not <c>null</c>, then the operation can be cancelled by
triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation

Cancelling a close will still leave the stream closed, but some streams
can use a faster close that doesn't block to e.g. check errors.
