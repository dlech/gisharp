<see cref="ThemedIcon"/> is an implementation of <see cref="IIcon"/> that supports icon themes.
<see cref="ThemedIcon"/> contains a list of all of the icons present in an icon
theme, so that icons can be looked up quickly. <see cref="ThemedIcon"/> does
not provide actual pixmaps for icons, just the icon names.
Ideally something like gtk_icon_theme_choose_icon() should be used to
resolve the list of names so that fallback icons work nicely with
themes that inherit other themes.
