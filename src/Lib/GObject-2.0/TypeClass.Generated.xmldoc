<summary>
This function is essentially the same as <see cref="TypeClass.Ref(GISharp.Lib.GObject.GType)"/>,
except that the classes reference count isn't incremented.
As a consequence, this function may return <c>null</c> if the class
of the type passed in does not currently exist (hasn't been
referenced before).

<param name="type">
type ID of a classed type

<summary>
A more efficient version of <see cref="TypeClass.Peek(GISharp.Lib.GObject.GType)"/> which works only for
static types.

<param name="type">
type ID of a classed type

<summary>
Increments the reference count of the class structure belonging to

exist already.

<member name='TypeClass.AddPrivate(int)'>
<summary>
Registers a private structure for an instantiatable type.
</summary>
<remarks>
When an object is allocated, the private structures for
the type and all of its parent types are allocated
sequentially in the same memory block as the public
structures, and are zero-filled.

Note that the accumulated size of the private structures of
a type and all its parent types cannot exceed 64 KiB.

This function should be called in the type's class_init() function.
The private structure can be retrieved using the
G_TYPE_INSTANCE_GET_PRIVATE() macro.

The following example shows attaching a private structure
MyObjectPrivate to an object MyObject defined in the standard
GObject fashion in the type's class_init() function.

Note the use of a structure member "priv" to avoid the overhead
of repeatedly calling MY_OBJECT_GET_PRIVATE().

|[&lt;!-- language="C" --&gt;
typedef struct _MyObject        MyObject;
typedef struct _MyObjectPrivate MyObjectPrivate;

struct _MyObject {
 GObject parent;

 MyObjectPrivate *priv;
};

struct _MyObjectPrivate {
  int some_field;
};

static void
my_object_class_init (MyObjectClass *klass)
{
  g_type_class_add_private (klass, sizeof (MyObjectPrivate));
}

static void
my_object_init (MyObject *my_object)
{
  my_object-&gt;priv = G_TYPE_INSTANCE_GET_PRIVATE (my_object,
                                                 MY_TYPE_OBJECT,
                                                 MyObjectPrivate);
  // my_object-&gt;priv-&gt;some_field will be automatically initialised to 0
}

static int
my_object_get_some_field (MyObject *my_object)
{
  MyObjectPrivate *priv;

  g_return_val_if_fail (MY_IS_OBJECT (my_object), 0);

  priv = my_object-&gt;priv;

  return priv-&gt;some_field;
}

<member name='TypeClass.PeekParent()'>
<summary>
This is a convenience function often needed in class initializers.
It returns the class structure of the immediate parent type of the
class passed in.  Since derived classes hold a reference count on
their parent classes as long as they are instantiated, the returned
class will always exist.

This function is essentially equivalent to:
g_type_class_peek (g_type_parent (G_TYPE_FROM_CLASS (g_class)))

the parent class
