<member name='NotifySignalHandler'>
<summary>
The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
its value set through <see cref="Object.SetProperty(GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8,in GISharp.Lib.GObject.Value)"/>, g_object_set(), et al.
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>
Note that getting this signal doesnâ€™t itself guarantee that the value of
the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
<see cref="ParamFlags.ExplicitNotify"/>, then any call to <see cref="Object.SetProperty(GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8,in GISharp.Lib.GObject.Value)"/> results
in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
If they did pass <see cref="ParamFlags.ExplicitNotify"/>, then this signal is emitted only
when they explicitly call <see cref="Object.Notify(GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8)"/> or <see cref="Object.Notify(GISharp.Lib.GObject.ParamSpec)"/>,
and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
</para>
<para>
This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
g_signal_connect() call, like this:
|[&lt;!-- language="C" --&gt;
g_signal_connect (text_view-&gt;buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
                  G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
                  text_view)
]|
It is important to note that you must use
[canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
detail strings for the notify signal.

<member name='Object.BindProperty(GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8,GISharp.Lib.GObject.Object,GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8,GISharp.Lib.GObject.BindingFlags)'>
<summary>
Creates a binding between <paramref name="sourceProperty"/> on this instance and <paramref name="targetProperty"/>
on <paramref name="target"/>. Whenever the <paramref name="sourceProperty"/> is changed the <paramref name="targetProperty"/> is
updated using the same value. For instance:
</summary>
<remarks>
<para>
|[
  g_object_bind_property (action, "active", widget, "sensitive", 0);
]|
</para>
<para>
Will result in the "sensitive" property of the widget <see cref="Object"/> instance to be
updated with the same value of the "active" property of the action <see cref="Object"/>
instance.
</para>
<para>
If <paramref name="flags"/> contains <see cref="BindingFlags.Bidirectional"/> then the binding will be mutual:
if <paramref name="targetProperty"/> on <paramref name="target"/> changes then the <paramref name="sourceProperty"/> on this instance
will be updated as well.
</para>
<para>
The binding will automatically be removed when either the this instance or the
<paramref name="target"/> instances are finalized. To remove the binding without affecting the
this instance and the <paramref name="target"/> you can just call <see cref="Dispose"/> on the returned
<see cref="Binding"/> instance.
</para>
<para>
Removing the binding by calling <see cref="Dispose"/> on it must only be done if
the binding, this instance and <paramref name="target"/> are only used from a single thread and it
is clear that both this instance and <paramref name="target"/> outlive the binding. Especially it
is not safe to rely on this if the binding, this instance or <paramref name="target"/> can be
finalized from different threads. Keep another reference to the binding and
use <see cref="Binding.Unbind()"/> instead to be on the safe side.

<summary>
Increases the freeze count on this instance. If the freeze count is
non-zero, the emission of "notify" signals on this instance is
stopped. The signals are queued until the freeze count is decreased
to zero. Duplicate notifications are squashed so that at most one
<see cref="Object"/>::notify signal is emitted for each property modified while the
object is frozen.

This is necessary for accessors that modify multiple properties to prevent
premature notification while the object is still being modified.

This function omits the property name lookup, hence it is faster than

One way to avoid using <see cref="Object.Notify(GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8)"/> from within the
class that registered the properties, and using <see cref="Object.Notify(GISharp.Lib.GObject.ParamSpec)"/>
instead, is to store the GParamSpec used with

<summary>
This function essentially limits the life time of the <paramref name="closure"/> to
the life time of the object. That is, when the object is finalized,
the <paramref name="closure"/> is invalidated by calling <see cref="Closure.Invalidate()"/> on
it, in order to prevent invocations of the closure with a finalized
(nonexisting) object. Also, g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are
added as marshal guards to the <paramref name="closure"/>, to ensure that an extra
reference count is held on this instance during invocation of the
<paramref name="closure"/>.  Usually, this function will be called on closures that
use this this instance as closure data.
