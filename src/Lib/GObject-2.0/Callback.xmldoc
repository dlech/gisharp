<member name='Callback'>
<summary>
The type used for callback functions in structure definitions and function
signatures. This doesn't mean that all callback functions must take no
parameters and return void. The required signature of a callback function
is determined by the context in which is used (e.g. the signal to which it
is connected). Use G_CALLBACK() to cast the callback function to a <see cref="Callback"/>.
