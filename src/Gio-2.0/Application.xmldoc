<see cref="Application.AddOptionGroup(GISharp.Lib.GLib.OptionGroup)"/>.

Signal handlers can inspect <see cref="Options"/> (along with values pointed to
from the <see cref="GLib.OptionEntry.ArgData"/> of an installed <see cref="GLib.OptionEntry"/>s) in order to
decide to perform certain actions, including direct local handling
(which may be useful for options like --version).

In the event that the application is marked
<see cref="ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine"/> the "normal processing" will
send the <see cref="Options"/> dictionary to the primary instance where it can be
read with <see cref="ApplicationCommandLine.GetOptions()"/>.  The signal
handler can modify the dictionary before returning, and the
modified dictionary will be sent.

In the event that <see cref="ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine"/> is not set,
"normal processing" will treat the remaining uncollected command
line arguments as filenames or URIs.  If there are no arguments,
the application is activated by <see cref="Application.Activate()"/>.  One or
more arguments results in a call to <see cref="Application.Open(GISharp.Runtime.UnownedCPtrArray{GISharp.Lib.Gio.IFile},GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8)"/>.

If you want to handle the local commandline arguments for yourself
by converting them to calls to <see cref="Application.Open(GISharp.Runtime.UnownedCPtrArray{GISharp.Lib.Gio.IFile},GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8)"/> or
<see cref="ActionGroup.ActivateAction(GISharp.Lib.Gio.IActionGroup,GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8,GISharp.Lib.GLib.Variant)"/> then you must be sure to register

<see cref="Application.Activate()"/> for yourself, however: just return -1 and
allow the default handler to do it for you.  This will ensure that
the `--gapplication-service` switch works properly (i.e. no activation
in that case).

Note that this signal is emitted from the default implementation of
local_command_line().  If you override that function and don't
chain up then this signal will never be emitted.

You can override local_command_line() if you need more powerful
capabilities than what is provided here, but this should not

Application identifiers follow the same format as
[D-Bus well-known bus names](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
For convenience, the restrictions on application identifiers are
reproduced here:

- Application identifiers are composed of 1 or more elements separated by a
  period (`.`) character. All elements must contain at least one character.

- Each element must only contain the ASCII characters `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_-`,
  with `-` discouraged in new application identifiers. Each element must not
  begin with a digit.

- Application identifiers must contain at least one `.` (period) character
  (and thus at least two elements).

- Application identifiers must not begin with a `.` (period) character.

- Application identifiers must not exceed 255 characters.

Note that the hyphen (`-`) character is allowed in application identifiers,
but is problematic or not allowed in various specifications and APIs that
refer to D-Bus, such as
[Flatpak application IDs](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/introduction.html#identifiers),
the
[`DBusActivatable` interface in the Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#dbus),
and the convention that an application's "main" interface and object path
resemble its application identifier and bus name. To avoid situations that
require special-case handling, it is recommended that new application
identifiers consistently replace hyphens with underscores.

Like D-Bus interface names, application identifiers should start with the
reversed DNS domain name of the author of the interface (in lower-case), and
it is conventional for the rest of the application identifier to consist of
words run together, with initial capital letters.

As with D-Bus interface names, if the author's DNS domain name contains
hyphen/minus characters they should be replaced by underscores, and if it
contains leading digits they should be escaped by prepending an underscore.
For example, if the owner of 7-zip.org used an application identifier for an
archiving application, it might be named `org._7_zip.Archiver`.

<member name='Application.AddMainOptionEntries(System.ReadOnlySpan&lt;GISharp.Lib.GLib.OptionEntry&gt;)'>
<summary>
Adds main option entries to be handled by this instance.
</summary>
<remarks>
This function is comparable to g_option_context_add_main_entries().

After the commandline arguments are parsed, the
<see cref="Application"/>::handle-local-options signal will be emitted.  At this
point, the application can inspect the values pointed to by <see cref="GLib.OptionEntry.ArgData"/>
in the given <see cref="GLib.OptionEntry"/>s.

Unlike <see cref="GLib.OptionContext"/>, <see cref="Application"/> supports giving a <c>null</c>
<see cref="GLib.OptionEntry.ArgData"/> for a non-callback <see cref="GLib.OptionEntry"/>.  This results in the
argument in question being packed into a <see cref="GLib.VariantDict"/> which is also
passed to <see cref="Application"/>::handle-local-options, where it can be
inspected and modified.  If <see cref="ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine"/> is
set, then the resulting dictionary is sent to the primary instance,
where <see cref="ApplicationCommandLine.GetOptions()"/> will return it.
This "packing" is done according to the type of the argument --
booleans for normal flags, strings for strings, bytestrings for
filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
do not pack a "false" <see cref="GLib.Variant"/> in the case that a flag is missing).

In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used.  For local options, it is
possible to either use <see cref="GLib.OptionEntry.ArgData"/> in the usual way, or to consult (and
potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.

This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
primary instance for handling.  <see cref="Application"/> ignored them completely
on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
<see cref="ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine"/> is unset.

If <see cref="Application"/>::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
filenames, then the use of %G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended.  If
<see cref="GLib.OptionEntry.ArgData"/> is <c>null</c> then %G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into
the options dictionary.  If you do use %G_OPTION_REMAINING then you
need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
(which treats them as filenames to be opened).

It is important to use the proper <see cref="GLib.Variant"/> format when retrieving
the options with <see cref="GLib.VariantDict.Lookup(GLib.UnownedUtf8,GLib.VariantType)"/>:
- for %G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, use <c>b</c>
- for %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING, use <c>&amp;s</c>
- for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT, use <c>i</c>
- for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT64, use <c>x</c>
- for %G_OPTION_ARG_DOUBLE, use <c>d</c>
- for %G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME, use <c>^ay</c>
- for %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING_ARRAY, use <c>&amp;as</c>
- for %G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME_ARRAY, use <c>^aay</c>

<member name='Application.AddOptionGroup(GISharp.Lib.GLib.OptionGroup)'>
<summary>
Adds a <see cref="GLib.OptionGroup"/> to the commandline handling of this instance.
</summary>
<remarks>
This function is comparable to <see cref="GLib.OptionContext.AddGroup"/>.

Unlike <see cref="Application.AddMainOptionEntries(System.ReadOnlySpan{GISharp.Lib.GLib.OptionEntry})"/>, this function does
not deal with <c>null</c> <see cref="GLib.OptionEntry.ArgData"/> and never transmits options to the
primary instance.

The reason for that is because, by the time the options arrive at the
primary instance, it is typically too late to do anything with them.
Taking the GTK option group as an example: GTK will already have been
initialised by the time the <see cref="Application"/>::command-line handler runs.
In the case that this is not the first-running instance of the
application, the existing instance may already have been running for
a very long time.

This means that the options from <see cref="GLib.OptionGroup"/> are only really usable
in the case that the instance of the application being run is the
first instance.  Passing options like `--display=` or `--gdk-debug=`
on future runs will have no effect on the existing primary instance.

Calling this function will cause the options in the supplied option
group to be parsed, but it does not cause you to be "opted in" to the
new functionality whereby unrecognised options are rejected even if
<see cref="ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine"/> was given.

<remarks>
This is the point at which the application discovers if it is the
primary instance or merely acting as a remote for an already-existing
primary instance.  This is implemented by attempting to acquire the
application identifier as a unique bus name on the session bus using
GDBus.

If there is no application ID or if <see cref="ApplicationFlags.NonUnique"/> was
given, then this process will always become the primary instance.

Due to the internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be
dispatched at any time (even if a main loop is not running).  For
this reason, you must ensure that any object paths that you wish to
register are registered before calling this function.

If the application has already been registered then <c>true</c> is
returned with no work performed.

The <see cref="Application"/>::startup signal is emitted if registration succeeds
and this instance is the primary instance (including the non-unique
case).

In the event of an error (such as <paramref name="cancellable"/> being cancelled, or a
failure to connect to the session bus), <see cref="GISharp.Runtime.GErrorException"/>

<member name='Application.Run(GISharp.Runtime.UnownedCPtrArray&lt;GISharp.Lib.GLib.Filename&gt;)'>
<summary>
Runs the application.
</summary>
<remarks>
This function is intended to be run from main() and its return value
is intended to be returned by main(). Although you are expected to pass
the the length of <paramref name="argv"/>, <paramref name="argv"/> parameters from main() to this function, it is possible
to pass <c>null</c> if <paramref name="argv"/> is not available or commandline handling is not
required.  Note that on Windows, the length of <paramref name="argv"/> and <paramref name="argv"/> are ignored, and
g_win32_get_command_line() is called internally (for proper support
of Unicode commandline arguments).

<see cref="Application"/> will attempt to parse the commandline arguments.  You
can add commandline flags to the list of recognised options by way of
<see cref="Application.AddMainOptionEntries(System.ReadOnlySpan{GISharp.Lib.GLib.OptionEntry})"/>.  After this, the
<see cref="Application"/>::handle-local-options signal is emitted, from which the
application can inspect the values of its <see cref="GLib.OptionEntry"/>s.

<see cref="Application"/>::handle-local-options is a good place to handle options
such as `--version`, where an immediate reply from the local process is
desired (instead of communicating with an already-running instance).
A <see cref="Application"/>::handle-local-options handler can stop further processing
by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes the exit status of
the process.

What happens next depends on the flags: if
<see cref="ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine"/> was specified then the remaining
commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance, where a
<see cref="Application"/>::command-line signal is emitted.  Otherwise, the
remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list of files.
If there are no files listed, the application is activated via the
<see cref="Application"/>::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
<see cref="ApplicationFlags.HandlesOpen"/> was specified then the files are opened
via the <see cref="Application"/>::open signal.

If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
commandline then you should implement your own <see cref="Application"/> subclass
and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
to return <c>true</c> from your local_command_line() implementation to
suppress the default handling. See
[gapplication-example-cmdline2.c][gapplication-example-cmdline2]
for an example.

If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.

If the <see cref="ApplicationFlags.IsService"/> flag is set, then the service will
run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
except in the case that <see cref="Application.SetInactivityTimeout(System.UInt32)"/> is in
use.

This function sets the prgname (g_set_prgname()), if not already set,
to the basename of argv[0].

Much like g_main_loop_run(), this function will acquire the main context
for the duration that the application is running.

Since 2.40, applications that are not explicitly flagged as services
or launchers (ie: neither <see cref="ApplicationFlags.IsService"/> or
<see cref="ApplicationFlags.IsLauncher"/> are given as flags) will check (from the
default handler for local_command_line) if "--gapplication-service"
was given in the command line.  If this flag is present then normal
commandline processing is interrupted and the
<see cref="ApplicationFlags.IsService"/> flag is set.  This provides a "compromise"
solution whereby running an application directly from the commandline
will invoke it in the normal way (which can be useful for debugging)
while still allowing applications to be D-Bus activated in service
mode.  The D-Bus service file should invoke the executable with
"--gapplication-service" as the sole commandline argument.  This
approach is suitable for use by most graphical applications but
should not be used from applications like editors that need precise
control over when processes invoked via the commandline will exit and
what their exit status will be.

<summary>
A <see cref="Application"/> is the foundation of an application.  It wraps some
low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
foundation for higher-level application classes such as
<see cref="T:Gtk.Appllication"/> or <see cref="T:Mx.Appllication"/>.  In general, you should not use
this class outside of a higher level framework.
</summary>
<remarks>
GApplication provides convenient life cycle management by maintaining
a "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can
be changed using <see cref="Application.Hold()"/> and <see cref="Application.Release()"/>. If
it drops to zero, the application exits. Higher-level classes such as
<see cref="T:Gtk.Appllication"/> employ the use count to ensure that the application
stays alive as long as it has any opened windows.

Another feature that GApplication (optionally) provides is process
uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by
providing a unique application ID. If given, only one application
with this ID can be running at a time per session. The session
concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
desktop login. When your application is launched again, its
arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
running program. The already running instance of the program is
called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus
is used for communication.

The use of <see cref="Application"/> differs from some other commonly-used
uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The
application is not expected to manually register itself and check
if it is the primary instance. Instead, the main() function of a
<see cref="Application"/> should do very little more than instantiating the
application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then
calling <see cref="Application.Run(GISharp.Runtime.UnownedCPtrArray{GISharp.Lib.GLib.Filename})"/>. All checks for uniqueness are done
internally. If the application is the primary instance then the
startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application
is not the primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary
instance and <see cref="Application.Run(GISharp.Runtime.UnownedCPtrArray{GISharp.Lib.GLib.Filename})"/> promptly returns. See the code
examples below.

If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the same as
that of of a
[D-Bus well-known bus name](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`, `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`,
`org._7_zip.Archiver`.
For details on valid application identifiers, see <see cref="Application.IdIsValid(GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8)"/>.

On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
on the user's session bus.  This means that the uniqueness of your
application is scoped to the current session.  It also means that your
application may provide additional services (through registration of other
object paths) at that bus name.  The registration of these object paths
should be done with the shared GDBus session bus.  Note that due to the
internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
(even if a main loop is not running).  For this reason, you must ensure that
any object paths that you wish to register are registered before <see cref="Application"/>
attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
<see cref="Application.Register(GISharp.Lib.Gio.Cancellable)"/>).  Unfortunately, this means that you cannot use
<see cref="Application.GetIsRemote()"/> to decide if you want to register object paths.

GApplication also implements the <see cref="IActionGroup"/> and <see cref="IActionMap"/>
interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
<see cref="ActionMap.AddAction(GISharp.Lib.Gio.IActionMap,GISharp.Lib.Gio.IAction)"/>. When invoking an action by calling
<see cref="ActionGroup.ActivateAction(GISharp.Lib.Gio.IActionGroup,GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8,GISharp.Lib.GLib.Variant)"/> on the application, it is always
invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
the session bus, and GIO provides the #GDBusActionGroup wrapper to
conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a #GDBusMenuModel wrapper
for remote access to exported #GMenuModels.

There is a number of different entry points into a GApplication:

- via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)

- via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)

- by handling a command-line

- via activating an action

The <see cref="Application"/>::startup signal lets you handle the application
initialization for all of these in a single place.

Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the
application, GApplication passes some "platform data from the
launching instance to the primary instance, in the form of a
<see cref="GLib.Variant"/> dictionary mapping strings to variants. To use platform
data, override the <see cref="DoBeforeEmit"/> or <see cref="DoAfterEmit"/> virtual functions
in your <see cref="Application"/> subclass. When dealing with
<see cref="ApplicationCommandLine"/> objects, the platform data is
directly available via <see cref="ApplicationCommandLine.GetCwd()"/>,
<see cref="ApplicationCommandLine.GetEnvironment()"/> and
<see cref="ApplicationCommandLine.GetPlatformData()"/>.

As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key
"cwd"), and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment
variables and their values) of the calling process (key "environ").
The environment is only added to the platform data if the
<see cref="ApplicationFlags.SendEnvironment"/> flag is set. <see cref="Application"/> subclasses
can add their own platform data by overriding the <see cref="DoAddPlatformData"/>
virtual function. For instance, <see cref="T:Gtk.Appllication"/> adds startup notification
data in this way.

To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
<see cref="Application"/>::command-line signal or override the local_command_line()
vfunc, to parse them in either the primary instance or the local instance,
respectively.

[gapplication-example-open.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gapplication-example-open.c).
