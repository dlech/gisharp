Queries a file io stream for the given <paramref name="attributes"/>.
This function blocks while querying the stream. For the asynchronous
version of this function, see <see cref="FileIOStream.QueryInfoAsync(GISharp.Lib.GLib.UnownedUtf8,System.Int32,GISharp.Lib.Gio.Cancellable)"/>.

internally, and any other operations on the stream will fail with

Can fail if the stream was already closed (with <see cref="GISharp.Runtime.GErrorException"/> being set to

the stream's interface (with <see cref="GISharp.Runtime.GErrorException"/> being set to <see cref="IOErrorEnum.NotSupported"/>). I
all cases of failure, <c>null</c> will be returned.

<summary>
GFileIOStream provides io streams that both read and write to the same
file handle.
</summary>
<remarks>
GFileIOStream implements <see cref="ISeekable"/>, which allows the io
stream to jump to arbitrary positions in the file and to truncate
the file, provided the filesystem of the file supports these
operations.

To find the position of a file io stream, use
<see cref="Seekable.Tell(GISharp.Lib.Gio.ISeekable)"/>.

To find out if a file io stream supports seeking, use <see cref="Seekable.CanSeek(GISharp.Lib.Gio.ISeekable)"/>.
To position a file io stream, use <see cref="Seekable.Seek(GISharp.Lib.Gio.ISeekable,System.Int64,GISharp.Lib.GLib.SeekType,GISharp.Lib.Gio.Cancellable)"/>.
To find out if a file io stream supports truncating, use
<see cref="Seekable.CanTruncate(GISharp.Lib.Gio.ISeekable)"/>. To truncate a file io
stream, use <see cref="Seekable.Truncate(GISharp.Lib.Gio.ISeekable,System.Int64,GISharp.Lib.Gio.Cancellable)"/>.

The default implementation of all the <see cref="FileIOStream"/> operations
and the implementation of <see cref="ISeekable"/> just call into the same operations
on the output stream.
